## Contributors

Anyone may be a contributor to Open Reserve projects. Contribution may take the form of:

* Asking and answering questions on the development forums
* Filing an issue
* Offering a feature or bug fix via a Pull Request
* Suggesting documentation improvements
* ...and more!

Anyone with a GitHub account may use the project issue trackers and communications channels. We welcome newcomers, so
don't hesitate to say hi!

## Maintainers

Maintainers have write access to GitHub repositories and act as project administrators. They approve and merge pull
requests, cut releases, and guide collaboration with the community. They have:

* Commit access to their project's repositories
* Write access to continuous integration (CI) jobs

Both maintainers and non-maintainers may propose changes to source code. The mechanism to propose such a change is a
GitHub pull request. Maintainers review and merge (_land_) pull requests.

If a maintainer opposes a proposed change, then the change cannot land. The exception is if the Governance Committee (
GC) votes to approve the change despite the opposition. Usually, involving the GC is unnecessary.
